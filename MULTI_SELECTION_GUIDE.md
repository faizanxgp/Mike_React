# üéØ Multiple File & Folder Upload - Usage Guide

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Folder Selection Only Showing Folders**
- **Issue:** `webkitdirectory` input only allowed folder selection, not files within folders
- **Solution:** Separated folder selection (with `webkitdirectory`) from file selection (without `webkitdirectory`)

### **Problem 2: Single Item Selection Only**
- **Issue:** Each selection replaced the previous one
- **Solution:** Implemented accumulative selection - each new selection adds to existing files

## üöÄ **New Features**

### **1. Separate Selection Modes**
- **üìÅ Select Folders:** Uses `webkitdirectory` to select entire folder structures
- **üìÑ Select Files:** Standard file selection for individual files (supports multiple)
- **üóëÔ∏è Clear All:** Remove all selected files and start over

### **2. Accumulative Selection**
- Select files first, then add folders
- Select multiple folders one by one
- Each selection adds to your current list
- Duplicates are automatically detected and skipped

### **3. Smart Duplicate Detection**
Prevents duplicate files based on:
- File name
- File size  
- File path (for folder structures)

### **4. Enhanced User Experience**
- Visual feedback showing current selection count and total size
- Tip message explaining accumulative selection
- Clear button appears when files are selected
- Drag & drop adds to existing selection
